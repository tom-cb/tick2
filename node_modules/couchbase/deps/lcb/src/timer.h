 * @param usec seconds from now at which the timer will fire
 * @param options flag of LCB_TIMER_* options. The options are:
 *  LCB_TIMER_STANDALONE: Don't peg the timer to the instance. This means
 *  the timer will not be associated with a call to lcb_wait and will
 *  thus not control the exiting or entering of the instance' event loop.
 *  The default is a standalone timer (for which instance must be provided)
 *
 *  LCB_TIMER_PERIODIC:
 *  Repeat the call to the timer callback periodically until the timer
 *  is explicitly stopped
 * @param callback the callback to invoke for each interval
 * @param instance the instance to provide for the timer. Required if the
 * timer is not standalone.
 * @param error a pointer to an error which is set if this function failes.
